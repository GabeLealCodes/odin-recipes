</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>½ cup yellow pepper, chopped</li>
  <li>1 ½ cups tomatoes, roughly chopped</li>
  <li>1 jalapeño, seeds discarded and roughly chopped</li>
  <li>¼-½ cup fresh cilantro</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li>
  <li>1-2 limes, juiced</li>
  <li>Black pepper, to taste</li>
  <li>Garlic or garlic powder, to taste (if desired)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    Heat 1⁄4 cup of water in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and celery and cook for 5 minutes. Add 2 cups of the Light Vegetable Broth and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to low and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes longer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Transfer the soup mixture to a high-powered blender and blend until smooth. Transfer the pureed soup mixture back to the pot. Add the remaining 4 cups of broth and bring to a boil. Add the broccoli and lower the heat to a simmer. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the broccoli is just softened. Do not overcook.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the same blender (no need to clean it), combine 2 tablespoons of water and the cannellini beans, cashews, turmeric, nutritional yeast, apple cider vinegar, miso paste, paprika, and black pepper to taste. Add 1 to 2 cups of soup mixture to thin the mixture, if necessary. Process until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if needed, until you reach your desired cheesy taste. Stir the bean mixture into the soup and heat over low heat until hot.
  </li>
