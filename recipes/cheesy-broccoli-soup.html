<h3>MAKES: 4 servings DIFFICULTY: Easy</h3>
<p>We eat first with our eyes, and the lovely green broccoli florets against a backdrop of cheesy broth will have you wanting to eat with your mouth, too. If you prefer a smoother soup, you can puree all or part of the cooked broccoli, but I find it more satisfying to bite into broccoli florets with every spoonful of soup.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
  <li>1 small yellow onion, chopped</li>
  <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
  <li>1 celery rib, chopped</li>
  <li>6 cups Light Vegetable Broth (here)</li>
  <li>6 cups small broccoli florets</li>
  <li>1 cup cooked* salt-free cannellini beans, drained and rinsed</li>
  <li>¾ cup raw cashews, soaked in boiling water for 30 minutes and then drained</li>
  <li>1 (¼-inch) piece fresh turmeric, grated, or ¼ teaspoon ground</li>
  <li>⅓ cup nutritional yeast</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon white miso paste</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
  <li>Ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Heat 1⁄4 cup of water in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, and celery and cook for 5 minutes. Add 2 cups of the Light Vegetable Broth and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to low and simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes longer.</li>
  <li>Transfer the soup mixture to a high-powered blender and blend until smooth. Transfer the pureed soup mixture back to the pot. Add the remaining 4 cups of broth and bring to a boil. Add the broccoli and lower the heat to a simmer. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the broccoli is just softened. Do not overcook.</li>
  <li>In the same blender (no need to clean it), combine 2 tablespoons of water and the cannellini beans, cashews, turmeric, nutritional yeast, apple cider vinegar, miso paste, paprika, and black pepper to taste. Add 1 to 2 cups of soup mixture to thin the mixture, if necessary. Process until smooth. Taste and adjust the seasonings, if needed, until you reach your desired cheesy taste. Stir the bean mixture into the soup and heat over low heat until hot.</li>
