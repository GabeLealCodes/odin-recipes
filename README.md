# ODIN RECIPES
# Foundations Course


## Description
This is my rendition of the recipes page as
assinged in The Odin Project, foundations
course.

I love plant based diet as it makes me feel great and all my bio markers hit
healthy range. My recipes are inspired by Michael Greger, M.D., founder of
nutritionfacts.org.

I am open to feedback and invite your thoughts and comments.
